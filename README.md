# KeeLoq
An implementation of KeeLoq by C programming language for embedded device.

## What is KeeLoq
KeeLoq is a proprietary block cipher owned by [Microchip](https://www.microchip.com/), and is used in remote key-less entry systems from several car manufacturers -such as [Chrysler](https://www.chrysler.com/), [Fiat](https://www.fiat.com/), [GM](https://www.gm.com/), [Honda](https://www.honda.com/), [Toyota](https://www.toyota.com/), [Volvo](https://www.volvocars.com/intl), [VW](https://www.vw.com/), [Jaguar](https://www.jaguar.com/index.html), [Iran Khodro](https://www.ikco.ir/en/), etc.- as well as for garage door openers. After the confidential specifications have been leaked on a Russian website [2] in 2006, several cryptanalysts have found substantial weaknesses in the design of the algorithm and the hardware on which it is implemented [1]. 

## KeeLoq Encryption
KeeLoq is a block cipher with a 64-bit key and a 32-bit block size. The cipher operates on two registers for 528 clock cycles to produce the ciphertext [1], based on the following shape:

## KeyLoq Decryption
KeeLoq decryption algorithm operates on two registers for 528 rounds, to produce the plaintext for a given key and ciphertext, according to the following shape.

## Test Vectors

```
key                | plaintext  | ciphertext
0x5cec6701b79fd949 | 0xf741e2db | 0xe44f4cdf
0x5cec6701b79fd949 | 0x0ca69b92 | 0xa6ac0ea2
